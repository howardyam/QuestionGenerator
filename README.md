Timeline
Week 1: Planning
In this week, we will define the requirements and goals for our website. We will create a site map and wireframes to plan out the structure and layout of our site. We will also identify the features and functionalities that we need to implement.

Week 2-3: Design and Front-End Development
In these weeks, we will start designing the visual elements of our website, such as color schemes, typography, and branding. We will begin building the front-end of our site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We will ensure that our site is mobile-responsive and user-friendly.

Week 4-5: Back-End Development
In these weeks, we will set up your ASP.NET environment and create a database for your site. We will write server-side code using C# to handle user authentication, form submissions, and other dynamic features. We will integrate the front-end and back-end of your site.

Week 6-7: Testing and Refinement
In these weeks, we will test our website thoroughly to identify any bugs or issues. We will refine the user experience by improving site navigation, performance, and usability. We will make necessary adjustments based on user feedback.

Week 8: Launch and Deployment
In this week, we will deploy the website to a hosting service and configure your domain. We will finalize any remaining tasks, such as setting up analytics or search engine optimization. We will launch your site and promote it through social media and other channels.
